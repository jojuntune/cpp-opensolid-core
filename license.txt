Different components of OpenSolid are licensed separately. Library components are licensed under the
LGPLv2.1, while the OpenSolid UI is licensed under the GPLv2; if in doubt, individual source files
also indicate which license they use.

From a practical point of view, this means you may use the OpenSolid shared libraries and
corresponding headers (those in the OpenSolid/Core, OpenSolid/Python, and OpenSolid/IO directories)
under the terms of the LGPLv2.1 but the UI itself remains licensed using the GPLv2.
